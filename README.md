This project is based on the W3.CSS Jane Bloglife template and demonstrates
advanced interactivity and state management using JavaScript. The website 
structure is built with semantic HTML and styled using W3.CSS, Google Fonts, 
and Font Awesome icons. The project enhances the static blog layout by 
implementing dynamic features such as interactive like buttons, toggleable
comment sections, and modal popups. JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM,
handle user interactions, and manage application state while maintaining clean
and organized code structure.
